# rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissors game made in JavaScript as part of The Odin Project

Currently updating the game to be played using an interface.

First version is playable in the console only and doesn't use loops.
The game will be visited later in the course to add a GUI and make the code 
more efficient.
